Key takeaway from this assignment:
1. A simple problem such as finding the second largest element from the array can be approached in many ways.
But is is hard to do it in with constraints such as a fixed number of comparisons and extra space used.

2. Here, we approach it in a 'tournament-playing' method where we check elements pairwise and get the larger one. 
Then in the set of larger elements we get the first time, we do pairwise comparison again. 
We do this until we get a single greatest element.All this is done in log(n) - 1 comparisons.
Then in n-1 comparisons, we get the second largest elements among the list of elements that have lost to the max element.
