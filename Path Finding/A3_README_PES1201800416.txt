Data structures used: 
- structures used for state, node and list
- array of function pointers to point to transition functions
- implemented a doubly linked list of nodes

To compile code:
Create a makefile of the three files. Input to client file being given from stdin.

Key takeaway from this assignment:
A problem like this could seem very simple to understand but the implementation could get very confusing if not properly planned before coding.
We learnt to visualise the same question in multiple ways: state space tree, and doubly linked list.
We understood how crucial a simple concept like backtracking could be in solving such problems where the computer has to get multiple solutions based on a set of production rules.
